# shopManagement
Shop management system is a program made to help
employees to manage tasks related to stock, inventory
of items, and creating daily and monthly earnings
report.
It has been coded in Python and utilises its various
functions to provide a user friendly interface to reduce
hassles related to data entry. It utilises data entered in
Microsoft Excel CSV and provides the user with
functions to check the current stock, update stock,
enter new items into the inventory of items or delete
an existing item from the inventory.
Shop management system also provides a function to
create bills manually while also maintaining a user
friendly approach.
It also allows the user to check the daily earnings for a
particular month, earnings for a particular day and
monthly earnings for a year utilising Pythons tkinter to
provide a graphical user interface wherever necessary.
The program utilises matplotlib to help generate
graphical representation of the net earnings for each
day of a month, each month of a particular year and to
compare earnings for each month of a year to
understand which month had maximum sales in that
year.
